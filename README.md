# Offical Game Repo

---

How is this organized?

Every person has their own branch that is labeled with their own name

Everyone MUST push to their own branch

Whenever we feel ready we will merge these branches onto master

The master branch MUST always stay as the last safe build just in case someone needs to port back to it

This means no merging without approval of another person that your branch is functioning.
